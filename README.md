# My Chess Game

On this proyect I'm trying to program a local game of chess with multiple game modes and an analysis option where I want to try to program my first AI.
This proyect is just for fun, I would like to learn with it, not only more about python, but actualy other languages

## Right now

Im refactoring this hole proyect in another repo [chess-on-console](https://github.com/Santicm23/chess-on-console) that focus only in the game logic and not in the playable view, to make the code more sustainable and readable.
